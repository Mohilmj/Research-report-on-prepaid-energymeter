# Research-report-on-prepaid-energymeter

The aim of this project is to minimize the queue at the electricity billing counters as well as to restrict the usage of electricity automatically, if the bill is not paid on proper time. This project also aims at proposing a system that will reduce the loss of power and revenue due to power thefts and other illegal activities. In this project the work system adopts a totally new concept of “Prepaid Electricity”. The Global System for Mobile (GSM) technology is used so that the consumer would receive messages about the consumption of power (in watts) and if it reaches the minimum amount, it would automatically alert the consumer to recharge for further usage . This technology helps in holding the good for all electricity distribution companies, private communities, IT parks and self-containing housing projects. The implementation of smart energy meter(prepaid) project will help in betterment of energy management, conservation of energy and also in doing away with the unnecessary hassles over incorrect billing. An automated billing system will keep tracks of the real time consumption and will leave little scope for disagreement on consumption and billing. A prior billing is bound to do away all the related problems of unpaid billings and human error in meter reading (parallax), thereby ensuring justified revenue for the utility.
